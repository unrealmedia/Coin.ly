Coin.ly: Real-time Bitcoin, Namecoin (and more) data mashup

The plan is to have a large, moveable, sortable datagrid that updates in real-time via ajax. The grid will display the current value of BTC vs other online currencies, pulled from their respective exchanges' APIs. The grid will also compare to USD, £, and other currencies based on current exchange rates.

Virtual Currencies I would like to integrate:
Bitcoin
Namecoin
Solidcoin
GroupCoin
DevCoin
ixcoin
i0coin
testcoin
ibcoin
